## Description

A curated collection of Forge tools with boilerplate code to build SSR Forge apps:

- SVF Saver: Download SVF files for an extracted model from Forge with Service Worker capturing the derivatives as Viewer renders the model- Downloader: Download a derivative or any web resource in chunks (so the request won't get timed out) and in parallel for better efficiency- HTTP Requester: Effortlessly make any (browser supported) HTTP requests to execute simple tasks like access tokens, model translation etc - Derivative Downloader: Parse a derivative manifest for an extracted model on Forge and download selected derivatives (SVF or other supported formats)
- PWA: Cache and view models offline - PWA ready
- Uploader: Upload an object in paralleled chunks - requires the recipient service to explicitly expose forbidden headers if needed
- Viewer Options Generator: Generate all possibile Viewer init/load options such as transform metrics easily ...
- Tutorial/Playground: Curated collection of interactive Forge tutorials & playgrounds

You may also find sample code here to:

- Develop Forge Viewer apps with Vue 
- Advanced usage of Workbox
